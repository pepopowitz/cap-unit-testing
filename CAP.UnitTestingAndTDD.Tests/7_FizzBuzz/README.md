## Instructions

Using TDD, follow the steps below. You are encouraged to attempt the steps one at a time, without looking ahead. 

1. Write a method FizzBuzz

2. that takes an integer between 1 and 100 as a parameter

3. and returns a string containing all integers from 1 to the value passed in

i.e. if 15 is passed in, it returns “1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15”

4. except for multiples of three, where the number is replaced with the word “Fizz”

i.e. “1 2 Fizz 4 5 Fizz 7 8 Fizz 10 11 Fizz 13 14 Fizz”

5. and for multiples of five, where the number is replaced with the word “Buzz”

i.e. “1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 ??”

6. and for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, where the number is replaced with the word “FizzBuzz”.

i.e. “1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz”
